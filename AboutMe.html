    <p>
      Hello, my name is Nicholas Eriser and I enjoy coding programs. It all
      started in 2015 when I wanted to learn how to make a video game. Learning
      how to do that lead me down the path of programming because video games
      are made with programming. I have an A.S. Degree in Computer Programming
      and Analysis.
